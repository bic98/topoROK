Instructions:

1. Please extract the compressed file and place the contents in the following directory: C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries.


2. Place the "Debug" file in the directory mentioned above.


3. Run the sample code provided.


4. Specify the path for files in the format (B010)_DigitalMap_00. Multiple files can be selected, and the tool will automatically search for .shp files within the folder.


5. The topoGraphy resolution parameter determines the terrain resolution. Higher values yield more detailed terrain but will take longer to process.
topoContour may take a long time to process depending on your computerâ€™s specifications. It is recommended to use a smaller, cropped area of the terrain.


6. If the resulting surface from topoGraphy appears in an undesirable grid pattern, use topoSmooth to convert the surface to a mesh for a smoother appearance.
